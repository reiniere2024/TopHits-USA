Hi All,

TopHits-USA is a small application that I have made to store all POP hits
that came out in the USA between 1965 and 2018.
You can browse POP hits through all the years and weeks and search for
Music Video's for the Music that you like.
You can also search for Artists and the songs that they brought out.

Good luck with this program. I used it for my Music Video hobby and it 
turned out to be very handy for me.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move the maps 
xml,Picts and Database to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Reiniere.
